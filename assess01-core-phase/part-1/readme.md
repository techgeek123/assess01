# Hey Freelancer! FixMySite, please? 

Since you have these kickass development skills now, your friends can't stop asking you to fix their websites. Since you're a good friend and also because this is good practice, you agree to fix your best friend Elon's blog.

## Release 0 : Style It! 

The blog which is written in `index.html` currently only has HTML written for it and doesn't look good at all. Your friend would like to make the following changes to it. You can use external libraries if required.

1) Change the font of the blog to a cursive font that will make it more readable.
2) Use a different font for the headings and the sub-headings
3) The background of the page should be dark gray and the text should be white
5) The name of the commenter should be italicized and be blue in color. It should be positioned on the extreme left of the comment
6) There should be a line differentiator between all the comments
7) A third of the page on the left should be left blank with all content being only on the right 2/3rd of the page 
8) The left 1/3rd should have links to the other pages of the blog. The pages are: 
    - Home Page - index.html
    - About Me - about.html  
        - This page should have Elon's [picture](https://www.biography.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_80%2Cw_637/MTE1ODA0OTcxOTUyMDE0ODYx/elon-musk-20837159-1-402.webp) along with a brief description about what he does.
        - He's given you details about his life in the file `aboutme.txt` All the headings are marked with "#"
        - Again the left 1/3rd of the page should have the links and the rest of thepage should have the content
        - The color scheme will be the same as Home
    - Contact Me 
        - This page should follow the 1/3rd rule 
        - This page will have a simple 'Contact me' button which lets a visitor send an email to the id `hiiamelonmus@musk.com` when one clicks on it


## Release 1 : Any comments?

Currently on the Home Page, you can't really add comments. Elon would like you to fix this. He wants the following to happen: 
1) The form and the 'New Comment' button should have some styling and look much better than the default option
2) The form should not be visible. Only the 'New Comment' button should be visible.
3) On clicking the Add comment button, the form should appear and the button should be hidden 
4) The text that is entered in the 'New Comment' form along with the name should be added to the existing comments as a new comment. 

The final output for adding the comments should be as follows:
