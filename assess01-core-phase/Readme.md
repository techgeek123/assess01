# Core Phase Assessment

# Instructions

This assessment is a way to gain insight into your current abilities with the concepts taught during the Core Phase. This assessment will provide insight into both your strengths and areas where you might need improvement. Success on this assessment means that you gain self awareness and expose your ignorance to Educators who want to help you get better. These are uncomfortable, but essential to learning.

There are 4 parts to this assessment. Completing 4 parts should take you about 6 hours. You are given *8 hours* to complete the assessment, so there is no need to rush. Also, you can attempt these parts in any order.

The files for each part of the assessment should be in its own folder. 

You have to attempt each part of the assessment. 

This means you might need to leave a part unfinished and move on. We'll get better insight into where you are in relation to the entire Core Phase curriculum if you've done some work on each part rather than you getting stuck on one part and not attempting other parts.

During the assessment you will most likely be asked to do something you don't remember exactly how to do. You are free to use online resources, notes, and even ask instructors for help. The only thing you cannot use is a fellow student.

Do not build more complexity than is explicitly required. We are not impressed by crystal palaces of magnificent syntax. We are impressed by readable solutions that meet requirements and a good verbal explanation of what you did.

- Part 1 - Add Style and Functionality to a Site
- Part 2 - Design a Game
